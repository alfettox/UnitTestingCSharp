 *  
 *  INTEGRATION TEST: test app with external dependencies as files, databases. Slower but give more confident. take more classes together
 * 
 *  END-TO-END : drive an application through UI. as in selenium. very slow, fragiles
 *  
 *  All together is the test pyramid 
 *  
 *  
 *  TESTING FRAMEWORK => MSTest, NUnit
